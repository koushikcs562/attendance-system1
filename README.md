# face-recognition-based-attendance-system  

Certainly! This project is a web-based "Face Recognition Attendance System" built using Flask, OpenCV, and machine learning. It automates attendance tracking by recognizing registered users' faces. It employs a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to recognize faces and maintains an attendance log in a CSV file. Administrators can add new users by capturing images of their faces. After recognizing a user's face, the system can send an SMS notification to their provided phone number. The web interface displays today's attendance and allows administrators to add new users. This project streamlines attendance management and reduces manual efforts, making it useful for educational institutions and similar settings.
